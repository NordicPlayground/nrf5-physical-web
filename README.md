# nRF5 Physical Web
A collection of tools and projects to help you experiment with the  Physical Web by using [nRF51](https://octopart.com/nrf51-dk-nordic+semiconductor-51435780) and [nRF52](https://octopart.com/nrf52-dk-nordic+semiconductor-67145952) development kits from Nordic Semiconductor.

The projects contain both firmware and web app source code which you may use as a starting point for your specific use case. All projects come with compiled `hex` files  which you may flash to your development kit without writing any firmware.
